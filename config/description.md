This phylogeny shows evolution of SARS-like betacoronaviruses including 6 samples from the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan. Coronaviruses from the Wuhan outbreak are colored in red, while related SARS-like coronaviruses are colored in blue. Click here to highlight the Wuhan outbreak clade.

The Wuhan coronavirus genomes were generously shared by scientists at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University (sample **WH-Human_1**) via this [post on virological.org](http://virological.org/t/initial-genome-release-of-novel-coronavirus/319), and by scientists at the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC (samples **BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019**, **BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-05/2019**, **BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-04/2020**) at the Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College (sample **BetaCoV/Wuhan/IPBCAMS-WH-01/2019**) and at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (sample **BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019**) via [GISAID](https://gisaid.org).
