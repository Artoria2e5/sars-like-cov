This phylogeny shows evolution of SARS-like betacoronaviruses including 6 samples from the novel coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan. Coronaviruses from the Wuhan outbreak are colored in red, while related SARS-like coronaviruses are colored in blue. [Click here to zoom into the nCoV outbreak clade](/sars-like-cov?clade=nCoV).

There were 5 SNPs present in the Wuhan samples in the first 11 bases of the alignment that were masked as likely sequencing artifacts. Additionally, sample BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-05/2019 may have sequencing artifacts that make it appear more diverged than it actually is.

The Wuhan coronavirus genomes were generously shared by scientists at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University (sample *WH-Human_1*) via this [post on virological.org](http://virological.org/t/initial-genome-release-of-novel-coronavirus/319), and by scientists at the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC (samples *BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019*, *BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-05/2019*, *BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-04/2020*) at the Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College (sample *BetaCoV/Wuhan/IPBCAMS-WH-01/2019*) and at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (sample *BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019*) via [GISAID](https://gisaid.org). We gratefully acknowledgement their contributions.
